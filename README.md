# C(++)ozy Heater
made this C++ TEMPLATE HELLHOLE to warm my hands and lap.

## usage
just `make -j4`, sit back and relax. (*\*note, for me it's `-j4` but you can set it at however you might*)
you can also adjust the number of files or the depth for each file by doing:
```
make -j4 NUM_FILES=6 HEAT_DEPTH=800
```

### NOTE!
it will fail most likely when you haven't generated the files yet, if it happens, either run the same \
`make` command again or run the `mkheat.sh` script manually, syntax: `./mkheat.sh <fileNum> <depth>`

### NOTE! (2)
you can also use the professional utility script `loop.sh` to magically make your laptop a portable oven

## ass-washing
just do `make clean` :)
